I wrote an app thats in the ios app store that gives a user information regarding nearby galleries.  In particuilar, the app, Enspire, shows you galleries within 50 miles of you. Morover, no public api exists that readily provides up to date information about art galleries (with the excpetion of artsy.com who would not give me permission to use their API). The purpose of this web app was to provide an admin portal that would allow gallery owners to enter info regarding their gallery (new exhibits, etc) which could then be retrieved via an api call from the app.
